As per their recent animal study 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. Following is a comparison of four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo).



* Scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
* Creating a scatter plot that shows how the number of [metastatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis) (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
* Scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
* Bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
