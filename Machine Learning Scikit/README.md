# Kepler
Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

To process this data created machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

## Preprocess the raw data
Tune the models
Compare two or more models

### Preprocess the Data

Preprocess the raw dataset prior to fitting the model.
Perform feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
Use MinMaxScaler to scale the numerical data.
Separate the data into training and testing data.
### Tune Model Parameters

Use GridSearch to tune model parameters.
Tune and compare at least two different classifiers.
Evaluate Model Performance

### Compare the performance of two or more classifiers to determine the best model performance.
